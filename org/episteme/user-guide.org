#+description: How to use Episteme

You got Episteme installed! Congrats.

This document will help you get the most out of it.

Keys that start with =C-= mean "hold control".

Keys that start with =M-= mean "hold alt".

Use =C-n= and =C-p= to get around. =Tab= will un/fold headings.

* Overview

Episteme is a knowledge-base system. It consists of:

- an editor
- documents making up the knowledge-base
- a system for pushing/pulling updates

The basic workflow is something like:

- pull down updates
- use the editor to search and navigate documents in the knowledge-base
- make edits to existing documents
- create new documents, move them around, etc
- push up any updates you made

** Foreknowledge

There are some things that will be helpful to know about to have a good time with Episteme. If you're unfamiliar with any of these things, you can reach out for help.

*** Managing files on your computer

Episteme keeps files in a couple places. You should be able to navigate around your hard-drive and open/delete files, etc.

*** Using the terminal

Occasionally you may need to use the terminal to run some commands. It'll be helpful if you know how to open the terminal on your computer, change directories, run commands, etc.

*** Using Git

Git is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control][version control system]]. It basically allows multiple to work on a bunch of documents in parallel, and to reliably merge their changes together into a cohesive whole.

Episteme uses Git to pull and push changes.

** Important Paths

There are two important paths used by Episteme on your machine:

- the git directory: where you downloaded Episteme
- the config directory: where Episteme stores data / where your =config.el= lives

*** The Repo Directory

This is where you downloaded Episteme. It contains:

- the knowledge documents
- the editor

This is where updates are pushed and pulled from. Do you know where you downloaded Episteme?

*** The Config Directory

This is where Episteme keeps its data (not knowledge docs though).

It is also where you put your =config.el= if you have customizations.

This is usually located at:

- =~/.config/episteme/= on linux
- =%USERPROFILE%\.config\episteme\= on windows

  =%USERPROFILE%= typically points to =C:\Users\YourUser\=

* Mastering the Basics

Episteme is built ontop of Emacs, and it can be a little foreign if you've never used it before. This section will give you the tools needed to confidently navigate and edit using Episteme.

** The Interface

The Episteme interface is made up of a few parts:

*The Frame*:
The primary "window" on your computer containing Episteme.

*Windows*:
The frame may be split into any number of sections called "windows".

*Buffers*: Every window displays a buffer. Buffers are just containers for text. Sometimes a buffer is displaying a file, sometimes it's used for on-screen interface elements. Everything you see is text in some buffer.

*Modes*: Every buffer is in a "mode". A mode is simply "the way a buffer behaves". When you hit the =f= key, does it insert "f" or does it activate some behavior? That depends on the mode!

*Keybinds*: When you press a key, what the key does, depends on what it is bound to. Keybinds are usually denoted like: =C-x g= which means "Holding control, hit x. Then hit g."

Here are some examples:
| C-x     | Holding control, hit x              |
| C-x C-x | Holding control, hit x twice        |
| C-x g   | Holding control, hit x. Then hit g. |
| M-x     | Holding alt, hit x                  |
| <f12>   | Hit F12                             |
| C-<f12> | Holding control, hit F12            |

*Minibuffer*: At the bottom of each window is a status line. This is the minibuffer where useful information will sometimes appear.

*Menus*: Menus are small popups that offer a number of items bound to keys. Pressing one of the keys will invoke the item. Menu items will sometimes do something, sometimes they will open additional menus.

** Something went wrong!

If you ever get stuck in some weird situation, you can try to hit =C-g= a few times. =C-g= is the "cancel whatever is going on" key.

If =C-g= doesn't work, you're probably in a "Debugger" window. Just hit =q=

If there are too many windows, you can hit =C-x 1= to get back to a single window.

** Exiting

To quit Episteme hit =C-x C-v=

This may ask you if you want to save unsaved buffers, etc.

** Editing Files

Here are a few useful keybinds for editing files:

*Files*:
| =C-x C-f= | open a file  |
| =C-x C-s= | save a file  |
| =C-x k=   | close a file |

*Buffers*:
| =C-x b= | switch buffers |
| =C-x k= | close a buffer |

*Windows*:
| =C-x 1= | close other windows |
| =C-x 2= | split horizontally  |
| =C-x 3= | split vertically    |
| =C-x 0= | close window        |

*Movement*:
| =C-p= | cursor up   |
| =C-n= | cursor down |

| =C-f= | left one char |
| =M-f= | left one word |

| =C-b= | right one char |
| =M-b= | right one word |

| =C-a= | beginning of line |
| =C-e= | end of line       |

*Deletion*:
| =<backspace>=   | delete backward one char  |
| =M-<backspace>= | delete backward one word  |

| =C-d= | delete forward one char |
| =M-d= | delete forward one word |

*Manipulation*:
| =C-m= | set mark (highlight) |
| =C-w= | cut marked region    |
| =M-w= | copy marked region   |
| =C-k= | cut to end of line   |
| =C-y= | paste last cut       |

** Menus
Episteme has a number of menus to make things easier.

- main menu: bound to =C-c x= by default
- mode menu: bound to =C-c m= by default

Some menu items will lead to other menus. Spacebar will return you previous menus, or close the last one.

*** The Main Menu

The Main Menu is your launch-pad.

By default, it is bound to =C-c x=

The Main Menu has a number of items when opened but the three most important ones are:

- =o=: open - navigate the knowledge-base and open a document
- =a=: all files - select a file from a list of all documents
- =g=: git  - push and pull updates
- =h=: help - get help on a variety of topics

The Main Menu can be closed with the spacebar.

*** The Mode Menus

When you open a file, based on its extension, Emacs displays that file in a buffer with a particular mode. Knowledge documents are in =org-mode=, text files are in =text-mode=, and so on.

For some modes, you can open a "mode-specific menu" that can assist with doing things related to that file type.

By default, it is bound to =C-c m=

** Navigating the Knowledge-base

To open a knowledge-base document:

- open the main menu
- press =o= to begin

You will be presented with a list of files/folders in the root of the knowledge-base. You can:

- use =C-n= / =C-p= (or the arrow keys) to navigate between items
- use =<enter>= to navigate further into the currently selected item
- use =C-<enter>= to visit the currently selected item
- use =M-<backspace>= to go backwards

Press =C-g= to cancel.

*** Listing all files

To select a document from a list of all files use the =a= main menu item.
